# MachineLearning-Maternal-Health-Risk-Classification
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, SVM) in R to classify maternal health risk levels based on clinical data. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques for multiclass classification problems in the healthcare domain.
